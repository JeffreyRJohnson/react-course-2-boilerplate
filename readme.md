This is the code from the projects in Andrew Mead's Udemy course The complete React Developer Course

https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition

I've done React courses from several Instructors and this is the best I've found thus far .

Topics covered include React Redux Webpack SASS Testing with Jest Deploying to Github and Heroku Firebase

None of this my original code
